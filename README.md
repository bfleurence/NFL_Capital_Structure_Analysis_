## Analysing NFL Capital Structures to Predict Win Percentage
By: Benjamin Fleurence 

## Overview
This repository provides readers with all the necessary data, R scripts, and files to understand and reproduce an analysis of nfl capital structure.

Within this paper, we analysed the different salary cap allocations employed by each NFL team to specific position groups, and ran a linear regression of those results on win percentage. 

The data used in this analysis comes from Spotrac, as well as sports-reference.

## File Structure
The repo is structured as:

data/01raw_data contains the raw data set downloaded from my computer. 
data/03cleaned_data contains the cleaned data sets used in our regression models. 
models contains r script used to construct regression model. 
other contains details about LLM chat interactions and sketches.
paper contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper.
Statement on LLM usage
LLMs such as ChatGPT were used to help formulate the questions for the simulated survey as well as for minor coding help.
